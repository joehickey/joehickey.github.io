      <description>How I work I am a clinical psychologist providing accessible, creative and evidence-based assessment and therapy in London. I specialise in working with children, adolescents and families experiencing emotional, behavioural and mental health difficulties. I have particular experience in school-based therapies and consultation to education settings.
I use therapeutic approaches that are supported by research evidence and psychological theory. I have training and experience in interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy, narrative therapy and attachment-based interventions.</description>
